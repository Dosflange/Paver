# Paver
Verilog description for 16-bit microcontroller in FPGA

These files are for an original 16-bit microcontroller developed from scratch. The system works fine on a Terasic DE1-SOC board at around 80MHz clock. It implements a native assembler and rudimentary OS based on a Forth interpreter, VGA output, PS/2 keyboard interface and media card storage.

In the subfolders, there are native implementions of Paver emulators with graphics consoles for iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.
