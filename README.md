Verilog description for 16-bit microcontroller in FPGA

These files are for an original 16-bit microcontroller developed from scratch. The system works on a Terasic DE1-SOC board at around 80MHz clock. It implements a native assembler and rudimentary OS based on a Forth interpreter, VGA output, PS/2 keyboard interface and media card storage.
